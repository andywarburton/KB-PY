## Whats in the repo?

Just want to order a KBPY? No problem, just download the KB-PY-GERBERS.zip and upload it to the PCB fab of your choosing. If you want to download the KiCad files and modify them, you can clone the repo to your local machine.

To make this work, you'll need to copy the contents of the CIRCUITPY directory to the CIRCUITPY drive on your Seeeduino XIAO or Adafruit QTPY.
